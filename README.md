# From 1 to Triangle

> Ever wonder how far the number 1 can go?

This isn't just a triangle. It's a glimpse into how a few lines of code can turn logic into patterns. Enter a number, and watch as a triangle formsâ€”line by line, digit by digit.

This project turns simple loops into a visual rhythmâ€”perfect for beginners who want to crack the code behind code.
